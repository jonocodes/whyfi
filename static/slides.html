## Reduce Phone Costs

Average phone bill = $73

"Unlimited" plans are not worth it

Use an inexpensive no-contract MVNO instead

### Low fee, total stock market, index funds

&nbsp;

- An index mutual fund is said to provide broad market exposure and low portfolio turnover.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Total stock market means it tracks all publicly traded US companies, weighted by the market. When companies get too small, they get filtered out of the index.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Index funds usually have only %10 the management fee of managed mutual funds.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- "My advice to the trustee couldn't be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and <u>**90%**</u> in a very low-cost S&P 500 <u>**index fund**</u>. I believe the trust's long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors who employ high-fee managers."

## Example Returns

Start with $10k in a saving account

- Bank savings rate = 0.5%

- Federal interest rate (40 year avg) = 5%

- Stock market growth = 8%

Put in an total stock market for 30 years:

<p class="fragment">do nothing = $100k</p>

## Index Investing Principals
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## There is a Major Crash Coming!

&nbsp;

- Crashes are inevitable

- Always expect them

- During a downturn stocks are "on sale"

<aside class="notes"><p>its about time we have one. the market is over inflated.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## You Cannot Time the Market

&nbsp;

- No one can tell the future

- Don't believe those who says they can
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## An Experiment

[Lets say you have $2k of cash to invest each year for 20 years, starting in 1993](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/does-market-timing-work)

- Kept in a checking account = $42k
- U.S. Treasury Bills (bonds) = $51k
- Worst timing S&P 500 = $72k
- Perfect timing S&P 500 = $87k

## The Market Always Goes Up

&nbsp;

Invest for the long term

- Over the last 40 years (1982-2022) the [average yearly market](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm) increase is 12.9%

### Don't Get Cold Feet

- Those who leave money in the market longer tend to have better returns.

- [People who perform best with funds are:](http://www.businessinsider.com/forgetful-investors-performed-best-2014-9)

  - Those who forgot about their investments<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Keep Disciplined

## Diversification

&nbsp;

- Total stock market index has 3,000+ US companies.

- But if you want more diversification there are index funds for developing countries, developed non-US countries, specific sectors...

- Or bonds, gold, real estate, etc. (see risk vs. reward)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## My Plan

&nbsp;

- Treat the index fund like my 401k and put in a fixed amount every month
- Keep over 90% in total stock market (including retirement accounts)
- When I turn 50 I will start to rebalance 25% into bonds (wealth preservation)

<aside class="notes"><p>I personally am not into early retirement or travel, but I like to be efficient</p>

## Tax Optimization
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reducing Taxable Income

&nbsp;

- 401k - retirement = $22500 / year
- IRA - retirement = $6500 / year
- HSA - like a long term investable FSA = $3850 / year
- 529 - college savings = $475k / lifetime in CA
- 457 - teacher savings plan = $35k / year
- Deductions, <u>stock donations</u>

### Credit Card Rewards

&nbsp;

Churning is the practice of signing up for credit cards that offer large signup bonuses in the form of miles, points, or cash back for the purpose of obtaining the bonus before canceling the card.

<aside class="notes"><p>not for everyone, but with a little organization its relatively easy and people treat it like a game</p>

## Will this Affect my Credit Score?

&nbsp;

Not if you play by the rules<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Example

&nbsp;

- Get a new credit card
- Spend $3k in the first 3 months
- Receive bonus of 60k travel points

Every 3 months open a different card and repeat
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Example plan

- Chase Southwest Business = 80k points
- Chase Southwest Personal = 75k
- Chase Sapphire Preferred = 60k
- Chase Ink Business = 100k
- United Explorer = 60k
- United MileagePlus = 50k

2 years later you have 450k points

worth $5000
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Return on investment

&nbsp;

Spend $350 in credit card fees and got $5000 in flights/hotels

vs

Put $350 in the S&P 500 and in two years that will be $420
