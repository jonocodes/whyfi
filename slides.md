* Financial Independence is about the journey to early retirement and/or pursuing to do what you want with your time.

* At its core, it is about maximizing your savings rate.

Note:
* Discovering and achieving life goals: â€œWhat would I do with my life if I didn't have to work for money?"
* Simplifying and redesigning your lifestyle to reduce spending. Your wants and needs aren't written in stone, and less spending is powerful at any income level.
* Working to increase your income and income streams with projects, side-gigs, and additional effort
* Striving to save a large percentage (generally more than 50%) of your income to accelerate achieving FI
* Investing to make your money work for you, and learning to manage/optimize those investments for the unique nature of FI/RE

Note: Retirement does not necessarily mean "quitting". Its just about having the freedom to do what you want.

FI is about assessing your earnings vs your spending. The size of your take home pay does not matter. If you save 100% of your earnings then you spend 0% of it and you dont need to work at all!


## Phases of FI

&nbsp;

1. Getting out of debt

2. ** Building wealth **

3. Preserving wealth

---

# How?

Note: here are some of the high level concepts. you can do any or all of these and take them to any depth.

---

## Get Out of Debt


&nbsp;

* Pay off highest interest loans first<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* etc.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* See Dave Ramsey for more info<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: we lost $40k to interest while paying off student loans.

---

# Get Frugal

Note: Some focus on earnings. But you can only control your job so much.

Many find its easier to take control of their spending instead of earning. This is where wise purchases come into play.

(Here in the bay area, cost of living makes spending control difficult, but its not a lost cause)

---

## Reduce Phone Costs

&nbsp;

Average phone bill = $73

"Unlimited" plans are not worth it

Use an inexpensive no-contract MVNO instead

Pay $0 to $30 per month

&nbsp;

Yearly savings ($25 vs $60) = ~$400 / per line

---

# ![](/images/mvnos.png)

---

## Eat Out Less

&nbsp;

On average Americans spend $1,000 to $3,000 a year on eating out for lunch

&nbsp;

Yearly savings (BYOL) = ~$700

Invest those savings in an index fund, and 10 years later =<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

~ $11,000<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note: you can buy a used car with that savings

---

## Buy a Gently Used Car

# ![](/images/buying_car.jpg)

Yearly savings of buying a 3 year old car = ~$1,000

Note: Most new cars depreciate 40% to 50% during the first three years of ownership.

---

## Ride a Bicycle

# ![](/images/sf_bike.jpg)

---

* Bikes are inexpensive
* Requires no insurance, registration, license, parking spaces
* Easy to own (storage, upkeep, replacement)
* Saves time and money for not going to the gym
* Reduces medical expenses
* Bonus:
	* Biking is statistically safer than driving
	* [Increases your lifespan!](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/06/13/bicycling-the-safest-form-of-transportation/)

&nbsp;

Yearly savings by biking instead of driving = ~$8,000

# Investing

&nbsp;

Put your savings to work

---

# ![](/images/risk_reward.png)

Note:
Jono's crude view of investment risks vs rewards
here is a terrible graphic I made

Banks / credit unions = %0.25
CDs / Money market = %1
Government bonds = %2-%3
Junk bonds = %6
(Interest rates) = %1 - %10
TDFs / Robo advisors
Index funds = %8
Individual stocks +/- %40
Collectables / Crytocurrency = -%50 to %1000

---

## Risk Tolerance

# ![](/images/stocks_vs_bonds.jpeg)

Note: the stock market can be volatile. you can loose money one day and gain the next. if any losses keep you up at night the stock market is not for you.

---

## Emergency Fund

&nbsp;

Keep 0 to 9 months of your living expenses in liquid cash (bank account) depending on your tolerance.

---

### Low fee, total stock market, index funds

&nbsp;

* An index mutual fund is said to provide broad market exposure and low portfolio turnover.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Total stock market means it tracks all publicly traded US companies, weighted by the market. When companies get too small, they get filtered out of the index.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Index funds usually have only %10 the management fee of managed mutual funds.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

* "My advice to the trustee couldn't be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and __90%__ in a very __low-cost__ S&P 500 __index fund__. I believe the trust's long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors who employ high-fee managers."

-- [Warren Buffett](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf)


Note: This guy is literally the best stock picker of all time.

---

## Example Funds

* Vanguard: VTSAX

* Schwab: SWTSX

* Fidelity: FSTMX

If you don't have access to total stock market:

* Find a broad market index

* Or something that tracks S&P 500, or Dow Jones, etc.

---

## Example Returns

Start with $10k in a saving account

* Bank savings rate = 0.5%

* Federal interest rate (40 year avg) = 5%

* Stock market growth = 8%


Put in an total stock market for 30 years:

<p class="fragment">[do nothing](http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/moneygrow/) = $100k</p>

<p class="fragment">[add $500/month](http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/moneygrow/) = $855k</p>

Note: mention bank gains loose money

## Index Investing Principals

---

## There is a Major Crash Coming!

&nbsp;

* Crashes are inevitable

* Always expect them

* During a downturn stocks are "on sale"

Note: its about time we have one. the market is over inflated.

---

## You Cannot Time the Market

&nbsp;

* No one can tell the future

* Don't believe anyone on TV who says they can

---

## An Experiment

[Lets say you have $2k of cash to invest each year for 20 years, starting in 1993](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/does-market-timing-work)

* Kept in a checking account = $42k
* U.S. Treasury Bills (bonds) = $51k
* Worst timing S&P 500 = $72k
* Perfect timing S&P 500 = $87k

Note: Source is Study by Schwab Center for Financial Research (2012). It was also tested against 68 different years/spans.

---

## The Market Always Goes Up

&nbsp;

Invest for the long term

* Over the last 40 years the [average yearly market](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm) increase is 12.6%

* Over the last 100 years the average yearly market increase is 12%

---

# ![](/images/stock_top.png)

Note: Even with these disasters...
* great depression
* world war II
* a handful of mediocre presidents
* vietnam war
* jfk assination
* melt downs, natural disasters, justin bieber
* cold war
* 9/11
* war on terror, war on drugs, war on christmas
* the great recession

---

### Don't Get Cold Feet

* Those who leave money in the market longer tend to have better returns.

* [People who perform best with funds are:](http://www.businessinsider.com/forgetful-investors-performed-best-2014-9)

    * Those who forgot about their investments<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    * Those who are dead<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note: to the young people in the room, time is on your side

---

## Keep Disciplined

&nbsp;

* Don't wait to invest

* Put money in regularly

Note: even if there is a dip in the market your earlier gains can make up for it

---

## Diversification

&nbsp;

* Total stock market index has 3,000+ US companies.

* But if you want more diversification there are index funds for developing countries, developed non-US countries, specific sectors...

* Or bonds, gold, real estate, etc. (see risk vs. reward)

---

## My Plan

&nbsp;

* Treat the index fund like my 401k and put in a fixed amount every month
* Keep 90% in total stock market (including retirement accounts)
* 10% in cash
* When I turn 50 I will start to rebalance 25% into bonds (wealth preservation)

---

## Tax Optimization

---

## Reducing Taxable Income

&nbsp;

* 401k - retirement = $19k / year
* IRA - retirement = $6k / year
* HSA - like a long term investable FSA = $3.4k / year
* 529 - college savings = $475k / lifetime in CA
* 457 - teacher savings plan = $35k / year
* Deductions, stock donations

---

### Credit Card Rewards

&nbsp;

Churning is the practice of signing up for credit cards that offer large signup bonuses in the form of miles, points, or cash back for the purpose of obtaining the bonus before canceling the card.

Note: not for everyone, but with a little organization its relatively easy and people treat it like a game

---

## Will this Affect my Credit Score?

Note: if you have good credit and are good at keeping it, this should not be bad for your FICO credit score

---

## Example

&nbsp;

* Get a Chase credit card
* Spend $2k in the first 3 months
* Receive bonus of 50k travel points

Every 3 months open a different card and repeat

---

## Example plan

* Chase Southwest Premier Business = 60k points
* Chase Southwest Plus = 50k
* Chase Sapphire Preferred = 50k
* Chase Sapphire Reserve = 50k
* Chase Ink Business Preferred = 80K
* United MileagePlus Explorer = 50k

2 years later you have ~300k points
worth ~$4k in flights/hotels/car rentals

Note: your mileage may vary, literally
