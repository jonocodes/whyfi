## What is FI?

# ![](/images/lawn_mower.jpg)

Note: Making enough money so you can move out of your parents house!

---

* Financial Independence is closely related to the concept of Retiring Early and pursuing to do what you want with your time.

* At its core, it is about maximizing your savings rate to achieve FI and have the freedom to retire as fast as possible.

Note:
* Discovering and achieving life goals: â€œWhat would I do with my life if I didn't have to work for money?"
* Simplifying and redesigning your lifestyle to reduce spending. Your wants and needs aren't written in stone, and less spending is powerful at any income level.
* Working to increase your income and income streams with projects, side-gigs, and additional effort
* Striving to save a large percentage (generally more than 50%) of your income to accelerate achieving FI
* Investing to make your money work for you, and learning to manage/optimize those investments for the unique nature of FI/RE
* Retiring Early

## The 4% rule

&nbsp;

You are ready to retire

once you can live on %4 of your savings per year.

Note: if your yearly cost is 40k, then you must have 1M saved
your savings will most likely continue to grow large after this

---

## Phases of FI

&nbsp;

1. Getting out of debt
 
2. ** Building wealth **

3. Preserving wealth

---

# How?

Note: here are some of the high level concepts. you can do any or all of these and take them to any depth.

---

## Get Out of Debt


&nbsp;

* Pay off highest interest loans first<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Etc...<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* See Dave Ramsey for more info<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

# Get Frugal

---

## Reduce Phone Costs

&nbsp;

Average phone bill = $73

"Unlimited" plans are not worth it

Use a cheap no-contract MVNO instead

Pay <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>0 to <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>30 per month

&nbsp;

Yearly savings (<i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>25 vs <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>60) = ~$400 / per line

---

# ![](/images/mvnos.png)

---

## Eat Out Less

&nbsp;

On average Americans spend <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>1000 to <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>3000 a year on eating out for lunch

&nbsp;

Yearly savings (BYOL) = ~$700

---

## Buy a Gently Used Car

# ![](/images/buying_car.jpg)

Yearly savings of buying a 2 year old car = ~$700

Note: Most new cars depreciate 40% to 50% during the first three years of ownership.

---

## Ride a Bicycle

# ![](/images/sf_bike.jpg)

---

* Bikes are inexpensive
* Eequire no insurance, registration, license, parking spaces
* Easy to own (storage, upkeep, replacement)
* Saves time and money for not going to the gym
* Reduces medical spending
* Bonus:
	* Biking is statistically safer then driving
	* [Increases your lifespan!](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/06/13/bicycling-the-safest-form-of-transportation/)

&nbsp;

Yearly savings by biking instead of driving = ~$8000

# Investing

&nbsp;

Put your savings to work

---

# ![](/images/risk_reward.png)

Note:
Jono's crude view of investment risks vs rewards
here is a terrible graphic I made

Banks / credit unions = %0.10
CDs / Money market = %0.20
Government bonds = %2-%3
Junk bonds = %6
(Interest rates) = %1 - %10
TDFs / Robo advisors
Index funds = %8
Real estate
Individual stocks > %20
Collectables
Crytocurrency = -%50 - %1000

---

## Risk Tolerance

# ![](/images/stocks_vs_bonds.jpeg)

Note: the stock market can be volatile. you can loose money one day and gain the next. if any losses keep you up at night the stock market is not for you.

---

## Emergency fund

&nbsp;

Keep 0 to 9 months of your living expenses in liquid cash (bank account) depending on your tolerance.

---

### Low fee, Total stock market, Index funds

&nbsp;

* An index mutual fund is said to provide broad market exposure and low portfolio turnover.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Total stock market means it tracks all publicly traded US companies, weighted by the market. When companies get too small, they get filtered out of the index.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Index funds usually have only %10 the management fee of managed mutual funds.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

[Warren Buffett says](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf) for most people their investments should be:

90% index funds, 10% bonds

---

## Example funds

* Vanguard: VTSAX, VTI

* Schwab: SWTSX, SCHB

* Fidelity: FSTMX

If you dont have access to Total stock market:

* Find a broad market index

* Or something that tracks S&P 500 or Dow Jones, etc.

---

## Example returns

Start with $10k in a saving account

* Bank interest rate = %2

* Federal interest rate (40 year avg) = %5

* Stock market growth = %8


Put in an total stock market for 30 years:

<p class="fragment">[do nothing](http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/moneygrow/) = $100k</p>

<p class="fragment">[add $500/month](http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/moneygrow/) = $855k</p>

Note: mention bank gains loose money

## Index Investing Principals

---

## There Is a Major Crash Coming!

&nbsp;

* Crashes are inevitable

* Always expect them

Note: its about time we have one. the market is over inflated.

---

## You Cannot Time the Market

&nbsp;

* No one can tell the future

* Don't believe anyone on TV who says they can

---

## The Market Always Goes Up

&nbsp;

Invest for the long term

* Over the last 40 years the [average yearly market](http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm) increase is %12.6

* over the last 100 years the average yearly market increase is %12

---

# ![](/images/stock_top.png)

Note: Even with these disasters...
* great depression
* world war II
* a handful of mediocre presidents
* vietnam war
* jfk assination
* melt downs, natural disasters, justin bieber
* cold war
* 9/11
* war on terror, war on drugs, war on christmas
* the great recession

---

### Dont Get Cold Feet

* Those who leave money in the market longer tend to have better returns.

* [The people who perform best with funds are:](http://www.businessinsider.com/forgetful-investors-performed-best-2014-9)

    2. people who forgot about their investments<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    1. people who are dead<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Keep Disciplined

&nbsp;

* Dont wait to invest

* Put money in regularly

Note: 
even if there is a dip in the markey your earlier gains can make up for it

when the market dips, everything is on sale
---

## Low Effort Self Management

&nbsp;

Takes a couple hours a year to check up on and rebalance if you want

---

## Diversification

&nbsp;

* Total stock market index has 3000+ US companies.

* But if you want more diversification there are index funds for developing countries and developed non-US countries, specific sectors.

* Or bonds, gold, real estate, etc. (see risk vs reward)

---

## My Plan

&nbsp;

* Treat the index fund like my 401k and put in a fixed amount every month
* Keep 90% in total stock market (including retirement accounts)
* %10 in cash
* When I turn 50 I will start to rebalance %25 into bonds (wealth preservation)

---

## Tax Optimization

---

## Reducing Taxable Income

&nbsp;

* 401k - retirement = $18.5k / year
* IRA - retirment = $5.5 / year
* HSA - like a long term investable FSA = $3.4k / year
* 529 - college savings = $475k / lifetime in CA
* 457 - teacher savings plan = $35k / year
* deductions, stock donations

---

### Credit Card Rewards

&nbsp;

Churning is the practice of signing up for credit cards that offer large signup bonuses in the form of miles, points, or straight cash back for the purpose of obtaining the bonus before canceling the card.

Note: not for everyone, but with a little organization its relatively easy and people treat it like a game

---

## Will this Affect my Credit Score?

Note: if you have good credit and are good at keeping it, this should not be bad for your FICO credit score

---

## Example

&nbsp;

* Get a Chase credit card
* Spend $2k in the first 3 months
* Recieve bonus of 50k travel points

Every 3 months open a new card and repeat

---

## Example plan

* Chase Southwest Premier Business = 60k points
* Chase Southwest Plus = 50k
* Chase Sapphire Preferred = 50k
* Chase Sapphire Reserve = 50k
* Chase Ink Business Preferred = 80K
* United MileagePlus Explorer = 50k
* Chase Freedom = $150

2 years later you have ~300k points
worth ~$4k in flights/hotels/car rentals

Note: your mileage may vary, literally
