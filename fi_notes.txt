	Jono's crude view of investment risks vs rewards
		
		here is a terrible graphic I made
	
		Banks / credit unions = %0.10
		CDs / Money market = %0.20
		Government bonds = %2-%3
		Junk bonds = %6
		(Interest rates) = %1 - %10
		TDFs / Robo advisors
		Index funds
		Real estate
		Individual stocks
		Collectables
		Crytocurrency = -%50 - %1000


		notes
			banks. fdic protection
			robo advisors. betterment and wealthfront. does a risk assesment, puts the money in, rebalances
			mutual funds ... "the amount of fund managers that can outperform the market is statistically insignificant" - jl collins
			real estate. causes debt, work			
			individual stocks.	very time consuming and rarely outperforms the market
			
			all the way at the bottom could be gold/guns if you think capitolism is going to collapse
