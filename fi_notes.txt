	(early retirement)

  invest the surplus
  avoid debt" - jl collins
 
 
 
simple math behind early retirement

	your time to reach retirement depends on one factor:

	Your savings rate, as a percentage of your take-home pay

	http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/
 

4% rule
	if your yearly cost is 40k, then you must have 1M saved
	your savings will most likely continue to grow large after this




details
	here are some of the high level concepts. you can do any or all of these and take them to any depth.


getting out of debt

* pay highest interest loans first
* etc...
* see dave ramsey for more info

frugality
	
	mvno phone
	
		phone service can cost $0-$30 / month
		
		yearly savings = ~$400 / per phone
		
	eat out less
	
		on average americans spend $1000 to $3000 a year on eating out for lunch
		
		bring your own lunch, savings = ~$700
	
	buy a gently used car
	
		biggest drop in depreciation in the first 2 years
		
		yearly savings of buying a 2 year old car = ~$700 ??
		
	travel by bike instead of car
	
		average yearly savings = ~$10k
	
		Bikes are virtually free
		require no insurance, registration, license, parking spaces
		easy to own
		saves time and money for not going to the gym
		reduces medical spending
		
		bonus: not only is biking safer then driving, it increases your lifespan, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/06/13/bicycling-the-safest-form-of-transportation/

	general budgeting
		track expenses
			spread sheet, mint, personal capital, ynab

investing
	
	Jono's crude view of investment risks vs rewards
		
		here is a terrible graphic I made
	
		Banks / credit unions = %0.10
		CDs / Money market = %0.20
		Government bonds = %2-%3
		Junk bonds = %6
		(Interest rates) = %1 - %10
		TDFs / Robo advisors
		Index funds
		Real estate
		Individual stocks
		Collectables
		Crytocurrency = -%50 - %1000


		notes
			banks. fdic protection
			robo advisors. betterment and wealthfront. does a risk assesment, puts the money in, rebalances
			mutual funds ... "the amount of fund managers that can outperform the market is statistically insignificant" - jl collins
			real estate. causes debt, work			
			individual stocks.	very time consuming and rarely outperforms the market
			
			all the way at the bottom could be gold/guns if you think capitolism is going to collapse
		
		
	
	risk tolerance
	
		the stock market can be volatile. you can loose money one day and gain the next. if any losses keep you up at night the stock market is not for you.
		
		stocks v bonds image
		

	keep an emergency fund
	
		0 to 9 months of your living expenses in liquid cash (bank account) depending on your tolerace

	warren buffet told wife... 90% index funds

	Low fee, total stock market, index fund
	
		An index mutual fund is said to provide broad market exposure, low operating expenses and low portfolio turnover.
		
		Total stock market means it tracks all publicly traded companies. weighted by the market. when companies get loose value or get too small, they get filtered out of the index.
		
		low fee 
		
			mutual funds often have 10x the fees
				
			index funds = %0.01 to %0.1
			managed mutual funds = %0.5 to %1
			
			on investments over a long period this can be a LOT of money lost
		
	examples
	
		vanguard: VTSAX, VTI
		schwab: SWTSX, SCHB
		fidelity: FSTMX
		
		if you dont have access to Total stock market
			broad market
			S&P 500 or Dow Jones, etc
		
		
	principals
	
		There is a major market crash coming!	
		
			there will always be market corrections
			see: risk tollerance
	
		you cannot time the market
		
			no one can tell the future
			dont believe anyone on TV who says they can
		
		the market always goes up
		
			invest for the long term and dont pull out
		
			https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-top-no-wait-this-is-the-top-2016-07-21
		
			over the last 40 years the market averaged an increase of %11.9
		
			according to research by fidelity:
			the people who perform best with funds are...
				1. people who are dead
				2. people who forgot about their investments

		low effort self management
		
			takes a couple hours a year to check up on and rebalance if you want
			
		diversification
		
			total stock market index has 3000+ US companies
			
			but if you want more there are index funds for developing countries and developed non-US countries, sectors etc.
			
			also bonds, etc
			
		dicipline
		
			dont wait to put money in
				you are loosing gains by keeping money out
				even if there is a dip your earlier gains can make up for it
			dont watch it every day
			dont panic and pull money out
			put money in regularly
				when the market dips, everything is on sale
			
		my plan
			treat it like my 401k and put in a fixed amount every month
			90% in total stock market including retirement accounts
			the rest in cash
			when I turn 50 I will start to rebalance into %25 bonds


tax optimization

	reduce taxable income
	
		401k - retirement = $18.5k / year
		IRA - retirment = $5.5 / year
		529 - college savings = high but varries by state
		457 - teacher savings plan = $35k / year
		HSA - like a long term investable FSA = $3.4k / year
		deductions / charitable donations


	managage your taxable investments well
	
		tax-gain harvesting
		tax-loss harvesting
		


Churning - the fun part

	"Churning is the practice of signing up for credit cards that offer large signup bonuses in the form of miles, points, or straight cash back for the purpose of obtaining the bonus before cancelling the card."
	
	not for everyone, but its relatively easy and people treat it like a game
	
		takes a little organization
		
	opening schedule chart

	Will this affect my credit score?
	
		if you have good credit and are good at keeping it, this should not be bad for your FICO credit score
	
	example schedule
	
		get a chase card, spend $2k in the first 3 months and get 50k travel points
		
		every 3 months:

		Chase Southwest Premier Business - 60k points
		Chase Southwest Plus - 50k
		Chase Sapphire Preferred - 50k
		Chase Sapphire Reserve - 50k
		Chase Ink Business Preferred - 80K
		United MileagePlus Explorer - 50k
		Chase Freedom - $150

		2 years later you have ~300k points
		which can be worth $4k in flights/hotels/car rentals
